    "\n",
    "* If time, we will introduce the concept of dropout.  \n",
    "* This is a method to help prevent overfitting and regularize a network.\n",
    "* The approach attempts to minimize co-dependencies between neurons and enhance robustness of network\n",
    "* Dropout has one parameter $p$.  In each iteration, you randomly exclude each neuron with probability $1-p$ during the training pass (in both forward and backward propagation).  Each iteration, you resample which neurons to keep and which to dropout. \n",
    "* Dropout is related to the concept of ensemble learning with the unique case that the various models in the ensemble share parameters and these models are \"combined\" into a single model/network at test as opposed to training a fusion model or doing a simple average between outputs. \n",
    "* During test, you use all neurons all the time. \n",
    "* Please see and read: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf"
